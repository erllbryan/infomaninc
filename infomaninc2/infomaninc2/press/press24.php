                  QAD Inc., a leading provider of enterprise applications for manufacturers has partnered with Information Managers, Inc. (INFOMAN) in a bid to further expand its foothold of the local manufacturing market.   </div><br>

                             <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                     At a press briefing held at the New World Hotel, Ong Chee Hian, QAD Asia regional sales director, said he expects INFOMAN, under the stewardship of former Oracle Philippines country manager Bernard Yu, to further expand its market in the Philippines by bringing in new customers.         <br>
                   </div><br>
                              <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                  "We are very pleased to be partnering with a leading software solutions provider in the Philippines in the delivery of QAD's MFG / PRO ERP and supply chain solutions to local and mid-market companies, "Ong Chee Hian said. "A local representative with the ability to cover the local market, deliver cost competitiveness, and ease customers' concern on issues such as local support is important to our initiative in every country we venture into where we do not have an office."       
                          </div><br>


                        <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
              Yu, country manager of INFOMAN, for his part is confident he will be able to meet the challenge posed by Ong Chee Hian. He said that compared to the 1980s, the local manufacturing market at present offers bigger opportunities especially in the food and beverages areas. "Today, there are a number of manufacturing firms that were not there in the 80s", he said.

                              <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
              According to Yu, Infoman is but a "right partner" for QAD since the former is also a distributor of Progress, the database on which QAD MFG / PRO is developed on.           <br>
