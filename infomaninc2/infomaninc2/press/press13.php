                              Manila, 28 April 2006 - Mr. Larry DiLoreto, VP Asia Pacific of Progress Software launched the Progress Day 2006 Philippines today at the New World Renaissance Hotel, Makati City with a keynote speech outlining Progress global strategy in view of recent acquisitions. This premier event is jointly organized by Progress Software and Information Managers, Inc. (INFOMAN), its sole distributor for the Philippines.

                              According to Mr. DiLoreto, Progress has extended the breadth of the Progress offering in the last few years by a series of acquisitions to round out the company's product offerings. The acquisitions of the Persistence and Apama companies brought even more capabilities to the suite of products offered through the RealTime division. Next came EasyAsk, a software that provides the search, navigation and merchandising functions on the web sites of some of the world's premier retailers and manufacturers. In January, Progress announced the completion of tender offer for NEON Systems, a leader in mainframe data access and SOA integration. The NEON products will broaden the reach of the DataDirect products to extend data connectivity into the large enterprise through the mainframe

                                The widespread move by organizations towards a service oriented architecture (SOA) increase the need to monitor and manage a network of discreet business services for maximum performance, reliability, and business fit. Progress acquisition of Actional enables Progress to meet this growing need with a full suite of services monitoring and management software. This acquisition marks a key milestone for Progress, and its operating unit Sonic, by changing the shape of the industry by bringing together two major SOA infrastructure technology segments: Web services management (WSM) and the enterprise service bus (ESB).

                            During the seminar, Mr. DiLoreto presented the current success and future visions of Progress for the Philippines and Asia as a whole. DiLoreto reports a sterling performance by Progress in Asia for 2005. Progress Asia exceeded revenue and earning goals in 2005, and greater than 60% of the distributors in Asia experienced double digit year over year growth.
