                             INFORMATION Managers, Inc. (Infoman) goes on high gear this year with its manufacturing solutions business following its acceptance recently of the QAD sole distributorship in the Philippines.

                             <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                           Infoman's confidence in the local market for QAD technology for the manufacturing sector is anchored on an expected increased demand for QAD's suite of software application modules by small and medium manufacturing enterprises. This quarter alone, some new QAD modules are slated to roll out in the country.

                            Infoman, which is also the sole distributor of Progress software products and Progress - based applications, had an impressive 110 percent new license revenue growth in 2005 for its flagship product, Progress OpenEdge v.10. This resulted in Infoman being named the second best license performer in Asia-Pacific.</div>    <br>

                        "The revenue growth is in manufacturing, education and government, and increasingly in food retail chains," said Bernard Yu, vice chairman and chief executive officer of Infoman.    </div>

                        "The revenue growth is in manufacturing, education and government, and increasingly in food retail chains," said Bernard Yu, Infoman vice chairman and CEO.

                          Early this year, QAD Inc. formally announced its partnership with Infoman to expand the former's foothold in the Philippine manufacturing environment, strong customer support and competitive pricing.                              </div><br>

                       "QAD's proven MFG / PRO Enterprise Resource Planning and Supply Chain Management solution and our IT expertise make a winning combination that will let us better meet our customers' needs," said Yu. "Our partnership with QAD allows us to offer a complete end-to-end solution for the manufacturing industries that complement our existing Progress solutions."      
                         </div><br>
     

                             <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                       
                     Yu said QAD technology fits the need of Philippine companies with legacy IBM AS 400 computing machines and the newer wave of manufacturing organizations of 20 year-old food retail chains   </div><br>

                            Martin Lopez, business development manager, QAD MFG / PRO division of Infoman, added: "Our implementation strategy follows the QAD strategy: use of best practice, vanilla implementation, no customization, and easy implementation and sustained education through the use of the QAD support We site."                   
                                  </div><br>

                       Yu said: "Local SMEs are reinventing themselves. If they become more innovative, then they won't have the baggage of old manufacturing companies. Our customers can now rely on our consulting and support services to implement and deploy QAD's ERP and supply chain solutions rapidly and cost-effectively. We put within their reach QAD's world - class solutions that enable them to take proactive steps to stay competitive in an increasingly global marketplace."
